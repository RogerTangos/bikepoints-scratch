def edge_betweenness_centrality(G, k=None, normalized=True, weight=None, seed=None):
    r"""Compute betweenness centrality for edges.

    Betweenness centrality of an edge $e$ is the sum of the
    fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through $e$

    .. math::

       c_B(e) =\sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|e)}{\sigma(s, t)}

    where $V$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of
    shortest $(s, t)$-paths, and $\sigma(s, t|e)$ is the number of
    those paths passing through edge $e$ [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    k : int, optional (default=None)
      If k is not None use k node samples to estimate betweenness.
      The value of k <= n where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
      Higher values give better approximation.

    normalized : bool, optional
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by $2/(n(n-1))$
      for graphs, and $1/(n(n-1))$ for directed graphs where $n$
      is the number of nodes in G.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
        Note that this is only used if k is not None.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : dictionary
       Dictionary of edges with betweenness centrality as the value.

    See Also
    --------
    betweenness_centrality
    edge_load

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is from Ulrik Brandes [1]_.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
    paths between pairs of nodes.
